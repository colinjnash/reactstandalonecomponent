### Overview

You are tasked with building a component that allows a user to build filter
rules. It is part of a larger form used to define Email/SMS Marketing
Campaigns. See the included PDF for the visual design, it shows the components
in its various interaction states. Treat the assignment as if you were writing
the component to  be included within the teams larger component library.

In addition to the presentational aspect, the application also needs to encode
these rules is a way that is suitable to send to the backend for processing.
You can write these out to `console.log` everytime a new filter is
added or removed.

We haven't listed all the implementation details here, so go ahead and use your
own judgement as to what is good user experience and good application design.
That said, if anything is really unclear feel free to ask.


### Technical Constraints

Source code should be in ES6 or above, using React with JSX.

Styles should be written as Styled Components.

The component must work in the lastest Chrome version.

For some filter scenarios the user will have to select a date. You can use the native Chrome date picker for this.


### What to Include

At a minimum your repo should include an `index.html` file that, when opened in
a browser, shows the component and allows interaction. Also include all your
un-transpiled source files. Also include a markdown file with any notes you have on your implementation. Whatever else you include is up to you.

Here are the possible vehicle models:

`1-SERIES, 6 SERIES, 640IX N55, ALL 4 COUTRYMAN ZC53, CAMION X1, SANTA FE SPORT,
530XI N52, 328DX N47T, 3 SERIES`


Base Build:

Currently running webpack with Stage1, ES2015, and React with Babel-Loader as the transpiler.

ESLINT rules are set to customized rules, although a switch to the AirBnb linter could be possible.

.gitignore needs to be tested to ensure all bloat is left out.

The goal will be to populate the initial data in state, then pass it on to dropdown menus with a callback saving the requested filters. There will then be a final check before populating the Filter List as seen in the design parameter.

Currently stuck on a bug that will not re-render the list and select default option for the form. It is definitely a problem with the rendering and/or key values, and the setup of state.

Clean up of handle functions also need to be addressed, as they can possibly be refactored into one event handler.
