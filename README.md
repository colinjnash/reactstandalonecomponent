*UPDATES*

SVG assets loaded. Media queries are now fixed for screens less than `980 px`. The form dropdowns will now display as block elements to keep styling intact.
Can't figure out how to remove assets from date picker. Tried the `::after` element on the `date-picker-indicator`, but was only able to remove the arrow and not replace with `icomoon` icons.
